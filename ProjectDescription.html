  <h2>Augumented Reality (Main Project)</h2>

  <label>Content:</label>
  <p>Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information,<br>
    sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory. AR can be defined as a system that fulfills three basic features: <br>
    a combination of real and virtual worlds, real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects. Examples: HTC Vive, Pokemon GO, Snapchat-Filters</p>
  <p>AR adds more possibilities to R&D and tries sets the technology standard higher. <br>
    If that would become a standard, many people couldn’t play because of the costs. It’s also a threat to companies because people want to use AR for glasses that delete billboards out of the AR.</p>

    <strong>Notice:</strong><br>
    The custom implementations are only starting ideas, we are still not sure if we can implement them.
  </div>

  <h3>Description of the implementations</h3>

  <p>
    Required Implementations – Photo tagging, saving positions:
    Photo tagging would function with javascript, detecting the mouse position and clicks on the image. We would
    enable users to create tags all around the image, with different colours and symbols for better overview. The
    users would be able to edit, save or delete these tags of the images. These images and their tags could be
    saved in a database which would identify each picture with its link.
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Presentation mode:
    We imagine the presentation mode as a wide-screen view of an image, where you could zoom into the picture
    and get a closer look of it. This could be useful if you’re tagging a map for example, where multiple tags could
    be close next to eachother and you still would be able to select between the tags. (If this still would make
    difficulties we might implement a panel where you could choose between the tags that’s currently around the
    mouse)
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Clickable link attachments for tags:
    This feature would be somewhat like the tags on the windows login-screen pictures. (“Do you like this image?”)
    A button would enable users to get more information about the part of the image the tag is pointing on.
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Custom colored tags and symbols for tags:
    For the sake of organisation users could manage the colors of the tags and select/upload symbols for them.
  </p>

  <h2>Organic Food vs. Fast Food (Alternative project)</h2>

  <label>Content:</label>
  <p>Organic food may contain more antioxidants and nutrients than regular food, although the evidence is mixed. <br>
    Consuming organic food may also reduce your exposure to artificial chemicals, hormones and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, it often costs more and may spoil faster.</p>

  <p>It can help reduce public health risks, mounting evidence shows that food grown organically are rich in nutrients, such as Vitamin C, iron, magnesium, and phosphorus, with less exposure <br>
     to nitrates and pesticide residues in organically grown fruits, vegetables, and grains</p>

  <label>Required implementations:</label>
  <ul>
    <li>Recipe upload</li>
    <li>Recipe Finder</li>
  </ul>

  <label>Extra, custom implementations:</label>
  <ul>
    <li>Recipe list sorted after categories</li>
    <li>Rating</li>
    <li>Commenting</li>
    <li>Allergy/Intolerance Warnings</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Description of the implementations</h3>

  <p>
    Required Implementations – Recipe Upload:
    Users would be able to upload their own recipes, maybe after a formula or maybe just their own plain text
    (which could be improved by custom tags that a script would initialize and format the text after them).
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Recipe Finder:
    There would be a recipe finder section which would look through a database searching after the right recipe by
    the criterias.
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Recipe List sorted after categories:
    If you don’t have anything on mind and just wanna surf through recipes you could do that with a list that would
    be divided into categories like salads, breakfasts etc...
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Rating:
    Users could rate eachothers recepies with stars.
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Commenting:
    Users could write comments under each recipe and discuss about it, maybe even leading the uploader to
    improve the recipe by it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Required Implementations – Allergy/Intolerance Warnings:
    Users could tag their recipe for different warnings which could improve the filtering mechanism: users could
    filter recipes after the warnings – only food with no/low sugar flour.
